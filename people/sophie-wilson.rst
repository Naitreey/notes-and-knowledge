- Studied computer science and the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos at the
  University of Cambridge

- Designed a microcomputer with a 6502 microprocessor inspired by the earlier
  MK14, which was used to electronically control feed for cows.

- Designed the Acorn Micro-Computer, the first of a long line of computers sold
  by Acorn Computers Ltd, including its programming language BBC BASIC.

- Hauser played a mental game where he told both Wilson and colleague Steve
  Furber that the other had agreed a prototype could be built within a week.
  Agreeing to the challenge, she designed the system including the circuit
  board and components from Monday to Wednesday, which required fast new DRAM
  integrated circuits to be sourced directly from Hitachi. By Thursday evening,
  a prototype had been built, but the software had bugs, requiring her to stay
  up all night and into Friday debugging.

- In October 1983, Wilson began designing the instruction set for one of the
  first RISC processors, the Acorn RISC Machine (ARM), The ARM1 was delivered
  on 26 April 1985 and worked first time.

- Wilson designed Acorn Replay, the video architecture for Acorn machines. This
  included the operating system extensions for video access as well as the
  codecs themselves, optimized to run high frame rate video on ARM CPUs from
  the ARM 2 onwards.

- now the Director of IC Design in Broadcomâ€™s Cambridge, UK office. She was the
  Chief Architect of Broadcom's Firepath processor.

- Wilson is a transgender woman.
