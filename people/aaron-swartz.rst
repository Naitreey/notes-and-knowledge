  of Technology (MIT) police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after
  connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet,
  and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from
  JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT. Federal prosecutors
  later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the
  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1
  million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and
  supervised release.

  (age 26) He hanged himself while under federal indictment for his alleged
  computer crimes. Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have
  served six months in federal prison. Two days after the prosecution rejected
  a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where
  he had hanged himself.

  applied to Y Combinator's very first Summer Founders Program proposing to
  work on a startup called Infogami designed as a flexible content management
  system to allow the creation of rich and visually interesting websites or a
  form of wiki for structured data. After working on Infogami with co-founder
  Simon Carstensen over the summer of 2005, Aaron opted not to return to
  Stanford, choosing instead to continue to develop and seek funding for
  Infogami.

  As part of his work on Infogami, Swartz created the web.py web application
  framework.

  In early fall of 2005, Swartz worked with the founders of another nascent
  Y-Combinator firm Reddit, to rewrite their Lisp codebase using Python and
  web.py. 

  Infogami's software was used to support the Internet Archive's Open Library
  project.
