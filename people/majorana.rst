On March 25, 1938, he disappeared under mysterious circumstances while going by ship from Palermo to Naples.
The Majorana equation and Majorana fermions are named after him. 
Experiments in 1932 by Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot showed the existence of an unknown particle that they suggested was a gamma ray. Majorana was the first to interpret correctly the experiment as requiring a new particle that had a neutral charge and a mass about the same as the proton; this particle is the neutron. Fermi told him to write an article, but Majorana didn't bother. James Chadwick proved the existence of the neutron by experiment later that year, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Majorana was known for not seeking credit for his discoveries, considering his work to be banal. He wrote only nine papers in his lifetime.
In 1937, Majorana predicted that in the class of particles known as fermions there should be particles that are their own antiparticles. This is the so-called Majorana fermion.
