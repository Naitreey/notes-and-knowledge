overview
========

- Sass -- syntactically awesome style sheets.

- Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled
  into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). 或者也可以看作是一种 CSS 领域的模板语言.

- SassScript is the scripting language itself.

- Sass extends CSS by providing several mechanisms available in more
  traditional programming languages, particularly object-oriented languages,
  but that are not available to CSS3 itself.

implementations
===============
- dart-sass (dart)
 
- ruby-sass (ruby)

- libSass (C++)
 
- js

libSass
-------
- A C++ implementation of Sass interpretation library.

- libSass makes it easier to integrate Sass into more software. Before libSass,
  tightly integrating Sass into a language or software product required
  bundling the entire Ruby interpreter. By contrast, libSass is a statically
  linkable library with zero external dependencies and C-like interface, making
  it easy to wrap Sass directly into other programming languages and tools.

- sassc: A CLI wrapper of libSass
