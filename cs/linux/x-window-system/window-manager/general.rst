tiling window manager
=====================
- a tiling window manager is a window manager with an organization of the
  screen into mutually non-overlapping frames, as opposed to the more popular
  approach of coordinate-based stacking of overlapping objects (windows) that
  tries to fully emulate the desktop metaphor.

- popular tiling window managers: awesome wm, i3, i3-gaps, xmonad.
