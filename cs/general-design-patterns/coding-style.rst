Comment
=======
- 珍惜你的注释. 只有在代码本身不能充分解释逻辑的地方才加注释.

  注释不能代替清晰可读的代码. 不能因为写了注释, 就允许它相应的代码写得混乱.
  
  You should always write your code as if comments didn't exist. This forces you to
  write your code in the simplest, plainest, most self-documenting way you can humanly
  come up with.

  when you can't possibly imagine any conceivable way your code could be changed to
  become more straightforward and obvious -- then, and only then, should you feel
  compelled to add a comment explaining what your code does.

- 注释解释的是为什么要这样做, 以及它是怎么做的 (如果说确实逻辑很复杂的话). 注释不解释
  代码做的是什么, 那是代码本身的功能.

- Too many comments (one per line, for example) is probably a sign of poorly written code.
