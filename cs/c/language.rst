overview
========

- statically and weakly typed language.

  * the type of expressions are determined at compile time. -- statically typed.

  * in certain cases, implicit type conversion is performed automatically. -- weakly
    typed. 但 compiler 同时还是会做类型检查, 并适时进行警告. 所以也不是 totally weak
    (like in javascript).
