- python driver 需要根据应用场景和需求来选择.

  目前主要的 python driver 以及各自的特点:

  * MySQL for Python (``MySQLdb``)

    - popular, mature and stable

    - not developed since 2013-06-28 (latest update date on sourceforge),
      essentially dead.
      https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python/issues/44

    - no python3 support

    - c extension, very fast

      https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/issues/342
      https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/PyMySQL_evaluation#Architecture_and_Performance

  * mysqlclient

    - popular (700+ stars on github), mature and stable

    - a fork of MySQLdb, adding python3 support, new features and bugfixes.

    - drop-in replacement of MySQLdb, 100% API compatiblity, even module names
      are the same.

    - recommended by django
      https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/databases/#mysql-db-api-drivers

    - python3 support

    - c extension, very fast (see reference above)

    - developed and maintained by the same group of people behind PyMySQL.

  * PyMySQL

    - popular (~3000 stars on github), mature and stable

    - pure python

    - python3 support

    - suitable for asynchronous applications (async, eventlet, gevent, etc.)

    - recommended by openstack
      https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/PyMySQL_evaluation

    - much slow than those written as C extension. (see reference above)

      (Though MySQL Connector is a pure Python library, while MySQLdb is largely
      written in C, and we could expect that the new module is a bit slower than
      the current one, performance may actually be improved. This is because the
      new module is eventlet aware, meaning threads will be able to switch while
      waiting for I/O from a database server.
      http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/oslo-specs/specs/juno/enable-mysql-connector.html
      )

  * MySQL Connector/Python (``mysql.connector``)

    - officially supported and actively developed by Oracle

    - pure python

    - python3 support

    - suitable for asynchronous applications (async, eventlet, gevent, etc.)

    - much slower than those written as C extension, also slower than PyMySQL.
      (see references above)

  根据以上分析, 我会选择 mysqlclient 和 PyMySQL, 在同步和异步的情况下使用.
