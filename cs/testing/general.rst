smoke testing
-------------
- A smoke test is a quick run through of a site;  it focuses on critical
  functionality to ensure the site can perform basic features. 

- It should only takes a couple of minutes to complete, up to ten minutes at
  most. What is great about smoke tests is you can perform them either daily or
  every other day.

- The term came to software testing from a similar hardware test -where the
  device passed if it did not catch fire (or smoked) the first time it was
  turned on!

regression testing
------------------

- A regression test is an in-depth, thorough examination of a site. It tests
  all of the complex user stories and detailed nuances of the site.

- It may take many hours to complete. Performing a regression test ensures any
  changes made did not negatively impact any of the functionality of the site.
  A regression test will cover every feature, new and old, along with bug fix
  checks to make sure bugs did not reappear in the software.
