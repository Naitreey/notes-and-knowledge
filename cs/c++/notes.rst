- C vs C++

  Modern C++ is usually written in an object-oriented style.  Modern C is
  usually written in a pseudo-object-oriented style using opaque types. But the
  mechanisms for working with the two vary widely. Notably, in C you have to
  build up the higher level abstractions on your own that are built into the
  language in C++.
