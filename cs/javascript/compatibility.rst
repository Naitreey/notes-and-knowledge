overview
========

- "Oh, We can't use shiny new features coz we must support ancient browsers."
  Shut the fuck up you piece of shit, LEARN TO USE POLYFILL AND TRANSPILER.

polyfill
========

- In web development, a polyfill is code that implements a feature on web
  browsers that do not support the feature.

transpile
=========

- Code written with ES6+ new syntaxes can be transpiled to legacy form, to
  support legacy browser.

- Transpilers should now be thought of as a standard part of the JS development
  ecosystem and process. JS is going to continue to evolve, much more quickly
  than before, so every few months new syntax and new features will be added.
