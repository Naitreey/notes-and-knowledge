- first-class entity and second-class entity. it is a term that barely has a
  technical meaning.  The meaning, when present, is usually comparative, and it
  applies to a thing in a language that has more privileges than a comparable
  thing.[SOFST]_

  Usually, first-class entity is an entity that can be passed as argument to
  functions, returned from function, modified, assigned a value, etc.
  
  But this is not always the case. The exact meaning of first-class/second-class
  thing is only made clear through context.
