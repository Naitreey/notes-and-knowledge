=====================
method: debug code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line to the
duck.

Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a problem to someone

does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent. [wikiRubber]_

Finding answer by explaining the problem.
面对不懂的问题, 有时会在努力清晰地描述问题的过程中就找到灵感, 自己把
问题解决了 (e.g. stackexchange). 这也是 rubber duck debugging. 这是对

More generally, teaching a subject forces its evaluation from different
perspectives and can provide a deeper understanding.
