- why machine learning?

  Because there are a lot of problems that are impossible or impractical to
  be solved by hand-written code.

- why machine learning 到 2010+ 才爆发?
  
  * 计算能力的爆发. CPU + GPU.

  * 大数据. 各种数据的数量和质量都有显著提高.

- deep learning networks is like legos.

definition
----------

- Machine learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
  without being explicitly programmed.

- Learning problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E
  with respect to task T and some performance measure P, if its performance
  on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

supervisored learning
=====================

输入具有特定标识或者特定值的数据, 期望构建一种算法, 它能够对样本之外的数据给出
符合预期的输出. 重点在于算法根据已有的数据进行预测.

regression problem

classification problem

learning theory
===============

置信度

size of data samples

unsupervisored learning
=======================

让算法自己去寻找输入数据中的特征. 而不给既定的输出值预期.

clustering algorithm

image processing

reinforcement learning
======================

not one-shot decision leads to certain consequence,
a sequence of good/bad decisions lead to certain consequence.
