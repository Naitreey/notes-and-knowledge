- What Java is good for?

  * big interprise software with many people involed in.  This is where Java's
    verbosity becomes useful. It's an enterprise language; a
    boilerplate-oriented language, which lets a larger team of more mediocre
    programmers create something without blowing it up.

- Java and its ecosystem is bad:

  * verbose, repetitive, boilerplate code everywhere.

  * Everything is a class is really stupid.
    
  * Extreme object oriented designs and major design patterns abuse.

  * Class naming convention is insane.

  * Packaging directory is insane.

  * XML configuration is insane.

  * Toolchain is horrible to use.

  * Memory footprint and startup time problem.

  * So many features available in other languages are not there for Java.

  * Too many artificial restrictions put in place by the designers of the
    language to keep programmers "safe" from themselves.

- Conclusion: Never learn Java.
