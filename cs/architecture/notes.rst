In a distributed application, different pieces of the app are called “services.”

service-oriented architecture
=============================

microservices
-------------
- The philosophy of the microservices architecture essentially equals to the Unix
  philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well".

- The services are small - fine-grained to perform a single function.

- The organization culture should embrace automation of testing and deployment.

- Each service is elastic, resilient, composable, minimal, and complete.
