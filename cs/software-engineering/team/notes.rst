- Never be the lonely programmer on a project.

  至少不要一直只有你一个人. 你有再强的自制力,
  与孤独作战始终是很难的、很不好受的.  另外如果项目开源, 那就不是一个人了.

      There's no one to review your code. There's no one to ensure that your
      code is checked in on time, labeled properly, unit tested regularly.
      There's no one to ensure that you're following a coding standard. There's
      no one to monitor your timeliness on defect correction. There's no one to
      verify that you're not just marking defects as "not reproducible" when,
      in fact, they are. There's no one to double-check your estimates. There's
      no one to bounce ideas off of, no one to help you figure your way out of
      a bind, no one to collaborate with on designs, architectures or
      technologies. You're working in a vacuum. And in a vacuum, no one can
      hear you scream.
    
      What good are nifty coding tricks if you can't show them off to anyone?
      How can you possibly learn the craft without being exposed to other
      programmers with different ideas, different approaches, and different
      skillsets? Who will review your code and tell you when there's an easier
      approach you didn't see?  If you're serious about programming, you should
      demand to work with your peers.
    
      It's a whole new kind of hell.
