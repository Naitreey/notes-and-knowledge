- traditional senario: Big desin up front. After a lengthy requirements
  gathering exercise, there is an equally lengthy design stage where the
  software is planned out on paper.

- The agile philosophy is that you learn more from solving problems in practice
  than in theory, especially when you confront your application with real users
  as soon as possible. Instead of a long up-front design phase, we try to put a
  minimum viable application out there early, and let the design evolve
  gradually based on feedback from real-world usage.

- YAGNI: You ain't gonna need it. As software developers, we have fun creating
  things, and sometimes it’s hard to resist the urge to build things just
  because an idea occurred to us and we might need it. The trouble is that more
  often than not, no matter how cool the idea was, you won’t end up using it.
  Instead you have a load of unused code, adding to the complexity of your
  application. YAGNI is the mantra we use to resist our overenthusiastic
  creative urges.

- Principle: The agile way of development, and the agile way of life in
  general.

  What to do:

  * Find out where you are

  * Take a small step towards your goal

  * Adjust your understanding based on what you learned

  * Repeat

  How to do it:

  * When faced with two of more alternatives that deliver roughly the same
    value, take the path that makes future change easier.
    (A good design is easier to change than a bad design.)
