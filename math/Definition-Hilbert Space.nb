The mathematical concept of a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, \
generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector \
algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and \
three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of \
dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the \
structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. \
Furthermore, Hilbert spaces must be complete, a property that stipulates the \
existence of enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus \
to be used.
Hilbert spaces arise naturally and frequently in mathematics, physics, and \
engineering, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest \
Hilbert spaces were studied from this point of view in the first decade of \
the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They \
are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, \
quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal \
processing and heat transfer)\[LongDash]and ergodic theory, which forms the \
mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term \
Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse \
applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful \
era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, \
examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, \
spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and \
Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.
Geometric intuition plays an important role in many aspects of Hilbert space \
theory. Exact analogs of the Pythagorean theorem and parallelogram law hold \
in a Hilbert space. At a deeper level, perpendicular projection onto a \
subspace (the analog of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]dropping the altitude\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of a triangle) plays a significant role in \
optimization problems and other aspects of the theory. An element of a \
Hilbert space can be uniquely specified by its coordinates with respect to a \
set of coordinate axes (an orthonormal basis), in analogy with Cartesian \
coordinates in the plane. When that set of axes is countably infinite, this \
means that the Hilbert space can also usefully be thought of in terms of \
infinite sequences that are square-summable. Linear operators on a Hilbert \
space are likewise fairly concrete objects: in good cases, they are simply \
transformations that stretch the space by different factors in mutually \
perpendicular directions in a sense that is made precise by the study of \
their spectrum.\

every Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis, and every element of the \
Hilbert space can be written in a unique way as a sum of multiples of these \
basis elements. The coefficients appearing on these basis elements are \
sometimes known abstractly as the Fourier coefficients of the element of the \
space.The abstraction is especially useful when it is more natural to use \
different basis functions for a space. In many circumstances, it is desirable \
not to decompose a function into trigonometric functions, but rather into \
orthogonal polynomials or wavelets for instance,and in higher dimensions into \
spherical harmonics.\nIn various applications to physical problems, a \
function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a \
differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms the \
foundation for the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum \
of the differential operator.\n\nSpectral theory also underlies certain \
aspects of the Fourier transform of a function.Whereas Fourier analysis \
decomposes a function defined on a compact set into the discrete spectrum of \
the Laplacian,",
 "the Fourier transform of a function is the decomposition of a function \
defined on all of Euclidean space into its components in the continuous \
spectrum of the Laplacian. "

In the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics, developed by \
John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a \
quantum mechanical system are represented by unit vectors (called state \
vectors) residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the state \
space, well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In \
other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a \
Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature \
of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system; for example, the position \
and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the \
space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a \
single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space \
of spinors. Each observable is represented by a self-adjoint linear operator \
acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an \
eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the \
value of the observable in that eigenstate.
The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the \
Schr\[ODoubleDot]dinger equation, in which the Hamiltonian, the operator \
corresponding to the total energy of the system, generates time evolution.
The inner product between two state vectors is a complex number known as a \
probability amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical \
system, the probability that a system collapses from a given initial state to \
a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the \
probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible \
results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator\[LongDash]which \
explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must \
be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can \
be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.
For a general system, states are typically not pure, but instead are \
represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by \
density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace one on a Hilbert space. \
Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, the effects of a single \
measurement can influence other parts of a system in a manner that is \
described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure \
both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more \
complicated than the idealization for pure states.
Heisenberg\[CloseCurlyQuote]s uncertainty principle is represented by the \
statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not \
commute, and gives a specific form that the commutator must have.\
